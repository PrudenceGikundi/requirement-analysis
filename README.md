**Requirement Analysis in Software Development**
This repo explains everything entailing requirement analysis, the process and the importance of requirement analysis in SDLC

What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. It involves understanding and documenting what is needed from a system or software application.

**Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
**Foundation for Development**: Requirements analysis forms the blueprint on which the entire development is based. This will help the developers have clear knowledge about what is to be developed, hence minimizing rework and thereby delaying the project.

**Clear-Cut Clarity and Precision**: Accurate and precise analysis of the requirements will help in evading misunderstanding by the project team and uniformity of being on the same platform. The clarity thus gained helps set pragmatic expectations and timelines.

**Avoids Miscommunication**: Clearly and elaborately defined requirements avoid miscommunication between stakeholders and the development team. This reduces the chances of errors in the final product and ensures it will meet the needs of the stakeholders.

**Improves Quality**: Well-defined requirements lead to better design, development, and testing processes. This eventually leads to a high-quality product that meets user expectations and performs as intended.

**Cost and Time Efficiency**: Early identification and fixation of potential issues during the requirement analysis phase save significant time and cost, as compared to identifying them later during the development process.

Three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is so important within the SDLC.

*Foundation for Development:* 
Description: Requirement analysis gives the blueprint for all development. It ensures the developers clearly understand what to be developed, thus reducing chances of rework and delays to the project.The consequences are scope creep, misunderstanding, and misaligned expectations of the project, hence leading to inefficiency and increased cost.

*Clarity and Precision:*
Description: With ample analysis and documentation of requirements, a project team may well avoid misunderstandings and keep all the parties on a mutual understanding. This clarity will help set realistic expectations and timelines.

Importance: Well-defined and clear requirements prevent misunderstandings between stakeholders and the development team by ensuring that the final product is what the stakeholders need.

*Improves Quality:*

Description: Well-defined requirements ensure better design, development, and testing. This, in turn, results in a high-quality product, which will meet user expectations and perform as intended.

Importance: Good quality assurance is possible when the requirements are known and documented, hence less chance of defects, making the development process easier.

**Key Activities in Requirement Analysis**
Requirement Gathering: Collecting requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.

Requirement Elicitation: Engaging with stakeholders to draw out their needs and expectations.

Requirement Documentation: Writing down the requirements in a clear and structured manner.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Analyzing the requirements to ensure they are feasible and modeling them to visualize the system.

Requirement Validation: Ensuring the documented requirements meet the needs of stakeholders and are achievable.
